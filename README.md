==========

Because inserting cat pictures into your projects should be easy.

**cat-a-pult** is a frictionless way of insert placeholder images into your projects as you are designing and testing them. Specifically pictures of cats. MORE specifically, pictures of cats from the wonderfull [placekitten.com.](http://placekitten.com)

### Usage ###

Download the minified [cat-a-pult file](https://github.com/troyericg/cat-a-pult/blob/master/_js/cat-a-pult.min.js) and include it in your webpage (for now, be sure you have JQuery loaded as well.)

```html
<script src="js/cat-a-pult.min.js"></script>
```

From there, any div with a class that begins with the word "cat" is automatically filled with an image element that uses the div's declared height and width as parameters for a placekitten URL that returns a cat photo to fill your element.

**Cats. All the time. It's that simple.**
